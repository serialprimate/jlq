# Commit Message Instructions

 When committing changes to this repository, please follow these guidelines for writing clear and informative commit messages:

 1. **Use the imperative mood**: Write your commit message as if you are giving a command. For example, use "Add feature" instead of "Added feature" or "Adding feature".

 2. **Be terse**: Summarize the changes made in the commit in a single line if possible. DO NOT include unnecessary details. DO NOT state intent, motivation or reasoning for the change. DO NOT include filenames or paths.If more detail is needed, add a longer description after a blank line.

 3. **Reference issues or pull requests**: If your commit relates to an issue or pull request, include a reference to it in the commit message (e.g., "Fixes #123").

 4. **Use proper formatting**: Capitalize the first letter of the commit message and avoid ending it with a period.

 5. **Do not mix unrelated changes**: Each commit should focus on a single task or fix. Avoid combining multiple unrelated changes in one commit.

## Examples

 Example commit messages:

 - "Fix bug in JSON parsing logic"
 - "Add support for multi-threaded processing"
 - "Update with new usage instructions"
 - "Refactor codebase"

 By following these guidelines, you help maintain a clean and understandable project history.
